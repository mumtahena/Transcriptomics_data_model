# Transcriptomics_data_model
This repository includes an XSD model for representing transcriptomics data to retain interoperability and computable meaning and an XML instance of the transcriptomics de-identified data for a patient from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).

# Description of the data files
* geneExpressionTestSchema_V5.xsd: The proposed XSD model schema
* nomralizedResultsXML_Count.xml
* Sample GE XML_Small.xml: XML instance containing a subset of gene expression from the TCGA patient sample for validation against our XSD schema 
* Sample GE XML_Large.xml.: Gene expression instance containing entire data from the TCGA patient sample for validation against our XSD schema


# How to run the models
* Clone this repository to your local drive
	* In terminal type: git clone https://github.com/mumtahena/Transcriptomics_data_model
	* or
	* You may use "Clone in Desktop" or "Download ZIP" buttons on the right side panel to download the repository.
